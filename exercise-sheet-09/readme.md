# Exercise 9 Recap
The Wiki page is nice to see whether you get correct results, but not suitable
for performance comparisons due to the different systems used for the evaluation.

Therefore, I have compiled a quick overview over the performance of your submitted
applications on my own system. Note that not all students' results are included,
only those which returned correct results without major modifications from my
side.

The best performing system (excluding mine) at each category is highlighted.
