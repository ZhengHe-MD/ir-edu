Code comments:
  * I have added some more in-depth code comments in copies of your source files.
    You can find them in the (hidden) .feedback/ directory in the corresponding
    exercise sub-directory.
    My code comments have the following syntax "// Note(esawin): <comment>".
    
Example implementations:
  * For some of the exercises, I will make my own implementations available at
    https://github.com/eamsen/information-retrieval-edu.
    You are welcome to ask questions and provide critique!
